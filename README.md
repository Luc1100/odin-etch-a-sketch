# Etch-a-Sketch
The goal of this project was to use basic javascript and html/css to create an etch-a-sketch like game. I chose a retro theme for mine once I saw how my chosen color palette looked with the default button style. I decided on a functionality of turning the pen on with a click and then hovering over pixels changes the color until you click again. 

The most challenging part of the project was probably a feature that I ended up leaving out of the final product. I made a feature that colored each pixel with transparency and then subsequent passes made the color darker until it was fully opaque. While I got this to work, I left it out of the final product because I wanted to keep a relatively simple theme.
